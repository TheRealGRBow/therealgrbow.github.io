          Hi Cassie, this is your 3 month anniversery present! I'm putting it
          together while on the call with you, cause #1, I dont wanna leave you,
          and #2, I love you.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-3">
          Babygirl, you mean the fucking world to me, I never want another
          moment in life without you. Just everything about you screams perfect
          to me. We have a lot of good times, and a few bad times every once in
          a while, but even during the rough rough shit, I would never want to
          spend a moment without you. I will always stay, I will always love
          you, throughout everything good and everything bad. I am going to be
          here for you.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-3">
          From the moment we started talking again back in July, to this moment
          right now, I have been head over mother fucking heels in love with
          you. I always wanted to be with you, and finally I got my girl, my
          girlfriend, you, on September 1st, 2024. I will always remember that
          date, well, I sure would hope so since like, its an easy to remember
          date, plus it's our anniversery lol. It will always hold a special
          place in my heart, the date I met my future wife. God I love you
          Cassie.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-3">
          Ya know, I don't think I hate a single thing about you, I think I love
          everything. Everything about you is perfect, from the strands of hair
          on your head, to the tipity tips of your toes. I love everything about
          you Cassie. Even your heart is good, at least from what I've seen. You
          care, you care aobut me, about your friends, about people in your
          life, even people you haven't met, and you'll say its BS, but you do
          care. It feels so good to have a beautiful girlfriend, a loving
          girlfriend, and someone I want to be with forever.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-3">
          Our happiest moments range from the dullest shit like playing Cookie
          Clicker, to random ass parkour maps on Minecraft, to even just
          laughing at YouTube videos. God I love the boring and the fun moments
          with you. Every moment with you is just as fulfilling and entertaining
          as the last. Every moment with you is worth spending, every moment
          with you is a moment that I want to be closer to you and with you even
          more than the last, because baby, I want you, and need you so bad. I'd
          rather nothing more than to just sit there and call you all day, even
          if we're doing nothing, even if we're driving each other crazy, that's
          all I want to do, be with you.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-3">
          Also, like, the level of care, and love I have for you is absolutely
          insane bro. I want to be with you and give you a hug and a kiss every
          time you get sad, every time you get mad, or even in our happiest
          moments, I just wanna hug you and hold you. I wish in your saddest
          moments that I could just wave a magic wand and make you feel better.
          I mean I do what I can from across the country, but without actually
          being with you, I feel useless. I care about every emotion you feel, I
          want you to feel you can talk to me about anything however stupid you
          might think it may be. I want our relationship to be built on that
          openness and understanding baby. I love you so much. And like, if
          anything ever was wrong, I want you to know I would literally rob a
          bank to have enough money to be with you, to take care of you, to give
          you the entire world if you were dying, make you feel better, and
          nurse you back to health.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-3">
          I can't wait to meet you and see you for the first time in person, God
          that'll be a special day. A day where I get to hug you, kiss you, hold
          your hand, and just hold you. A day where I can make you feel like the
          only woman in the world, it'll be a day that will be special for the
          rest of our lives, and I NEED it to come soon. I need to be able to
          sleep with you, I need to be able to cuddle you, I need to be able to
          remind you that you are my only reason for living, I need to remind
          you that you are my only love, and the last love I'll ever have.
